## Planned Features:
* Syntax Highlighting for a collection of languages
* Plugin System to for example make all the features compatible with additional languages
* Git Integration
* Theme System with CSS stylesheets
* Project initialization feature, maybe with a web-viewer linking to the official initialization websites and auto-setup of the files

## More essential ToDo's
* Project creating and overview window
* Designing the editing view
* Renaming stuff
* Syntax highlighting, Java just for now
* After the above essentials are implemented, make a first release
